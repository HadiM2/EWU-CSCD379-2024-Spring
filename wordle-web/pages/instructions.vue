        &ensp; The goal of the game is to guess the Word of the day in 6 tries or less.
        The word is a 5 letter word and you can only guess words that are 5 letters long which are real valid words. After each guess, you will
        be given the states of each letter. The letters will be colored as follows: green for is in the correct postion and is the right letter
        yellow for the letter is in the word but in the wrong position, gray/other color for the letter is not in the word. For example, if the word of the day is "GROVE"
        if you guess "BLIMB" you will see all green letters.
